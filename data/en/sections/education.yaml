      title: Fast CPU-based software retina
      description: A biologically inspired software retina system that compress visual inputs to reduce memory requirements in areas such as robotics and deep learning. The project presents a library that offers a CPU-based acceleration of the present retina sampling algorithm by parallelizing code computations for real-time applications and a software retina generator to overcome issues arising from software retina distribution. The final evaluation proved that the user-friendly open-source software retina library is capable of real-time sampling performance, up to 180x speedup and a software retina generator that offers increasing speedup factor with software retina size, when compared to prior implementations.
    bachelorsThesis:
      title: Robotics Web App
      description: The complex lab environment set up process results in a high cognitive load on Robotics Foundation students and may lead to a great deal of inconvenience. The Robotics Web App has been built to remove any need for students to install and set up an environment before working on the lab exercises. This allows users to concentrate solely on completing their weekly lab exercises. In particular, the web application provides several functionalities, including coding in Jupyter Notebooks, viewing robot visualisations, and receiving individual feedback from course coordinators. The evaluation of the web application proved that most project requirements were met and could be highly considered as an alternative platform for students to complete their lab exercises.
